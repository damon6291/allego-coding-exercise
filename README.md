Allego Coding Exercise

--

This exercise is built with HTML, JS, and CSS. Also used JQuery and Fontawesome throughout the exercise.

**Assumptions:**

1. Only the Ellipsis button has functionality.
2. Dropdown contains buttons that do not have any functionality yet.
3. Processing the data takes atleast 2 seconds. (Because processing `loadContent()` function is short, I gave 2 second timeout to show the spinning animation)
4. Initial `loadContent()` function had errors such as `` Number('`3')  ``and `content += results + '<span><div>';`
5. Dropdown toggles off when clicked elsewhere.
6. Dialog toggles off only if the x button is clicked.
7. Mobile friendly.

**Others:**

1. I used bootstrap like CSS class for this assignment. If Allego believes creating a specific CSS class for the different elements is better, I can adapt to it easily.
2. I tried to create the exercise reusable as possible by implementing functions with props.
3. I couldn't find any attached graphics except for the referenced PNG files. I used Fontawesome to fulfill the graphics part.
